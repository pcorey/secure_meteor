  <p>Learn to build secure Meteor applications by looking at potential vulnerabilities and how to prevent them.</p>
</div>

Meteor is a truly amazing web development framework that has opened the doors to software development efficiency and productivity unlike any framework that has come before it.

That said, new ideas and techniques used by the framework can lead to confusion about how to build secure applications. Even the confidence given to us by Meteor can lead to a more casual attitude about your application’s security.

Why should you worry about the security of your application, anyways?

Security is fundamental to everything we do as software creators. It is an underlying assumption that makes everything we do possible. We spend countless hours building an effective team, developing amazing software and nurturing trust with our users, but all of that falls to the floor without security.

Imagine your company is doing well. Your application is a pleasure to use, and your user base is rapidly growing. You’ve attracted investors and you’ve built yourself an amazing team.

But suddenly, everything changes. A malicious user has managed to find and exploit a severe vulnerability within your application. Their attack has negatively impacted hundreds users.

The hard earned trust between those affected users and your company vanishes instantly. Other users, when they learn of the attack, quickly begin to lose trust as well. Now, one of the first results when people google your product is a scathing TechCrunch article outlining the gory details of the attack. Soon, investors lose interest. With their lack of support and a rapidly dwindling user base, you realize that you won’t be able to make payroll this month.

The question of “why security?” is answered simply: __Because everything we do depends on it.__

Security isn’t something that can be tacked on at the end of the software development process. Building vulnerability-free software is a holistic process, and security should be considered along every step of the way.
